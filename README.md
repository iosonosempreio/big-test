# How to run this locally

- check you have Ruby installed on your machine, open Terminal and type `ruby --version`
- if you do not get something like `ruby 2.X.X`, you must [install ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) (On macOS (High) Sierra and OS X El Capitan, Ruby should be included already)
- after you verified that you have Ruby, install Bundler by typing `gem install bundler` (in case it fails because of lack of permissions, do `sudo gem install bundler` and type your system password)
- fork and clone locally this repository with GitHub Desktop
- open the repository into terminal and type `bundle install`
- run the website by typing into Terminal `bundle exec jekyll serve --watch`
- your website should be now running locally at [http://127.0.0.1:4000](http://127.0.0.1:4000)
